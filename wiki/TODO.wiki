Overall:
   Make a more descriptive dashboard so to say.
   User Permissions:
   User permissions should be setup as follows. Each number should be setup in ./classes/permissions.php
   * 1: Login
   * 2: Read/Send Mail
   * 3: Administer News
   * 4: Administer Matches
   * 5: Administer Teams
   * 6: Administer Bans
   * 7: Administer Pages
   * 8: Administer Users
   * 9: Administer Logs
   These permissions need to be redone
Mail:
   Make a universal timestamp
   Send to more then one person
   Send to an entire team
   Edit CSS to better display all of the messages and such
   Back and forth button to read through messages
News:
   Allow editing of news articles
   Modulize the entire edit/new form for easy use
   Matches:
   Create Match SQL Table
   Add formula for calculating match +/- points
   Calculate activity each time a match is played
Teams:
   Add detail page for teams
   Add edit page for teams
   Look into error messages better so we can tell the user exactly what they did wrong
Players:
   List all players here
   Allow players to edit their profile from this page and home page
   Allow viewing of other profiles and editing through user manager
Pages:
   Allow better functionality for adding/deleteing/renaming pages (right now theres four static pages)
User Manager:
   Show all users, last login, 
Team Manager:
   View all teams
   Revive a team
   Edit team information
Logs:
   Eventually hope to have an LogEvent function which logs all user actions
   LogEvent would make it simple and would be a log of the userid, page, time, and a short description of the action
